##About this project
This example project was first posted to the Unity forums [here](https://forum.unity.com/threads/skewed-rotation-when-character-looks-up-and-down-he-also-moves-side-to-side.860908)

This project was created using Unity 2019.3.6f, with Animation Rigging 0.2.6 preview.

The character used is "Vanguard" from Adobe Mixamo and the idle animation is "Rifle standing idle", also from Mixamo.

I intend for this project to be used to learn about how to use the Animation Rigging package, as a supplement to the less than ideal official documentation.

##How to use this project
Clone the project and open it in Unity 2019.3.6 or newer. 
Play the project and move the red circle effector around in the scene view.
Watch the character as its head and spine rotate to face the red circle.
